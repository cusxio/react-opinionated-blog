This website is purely static, but works like a single page application. Feel free to navigate around, no GET request ! Hence, it can work without JavaScript too.

## The Tech Stack:

### Frontend:
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [React-Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

### Hosted on:
- Amazon [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

### CDN via:
- Amazon [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)

### DNS via:
- Amazon [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)

Everything you are reading right now is generated from [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to ensure the **perfect** writing experience. No HTML. NADA.

Everything is open sourced [@GitHub](https://github.com/cusxio).

> More information about how this is all done in the future :)
